Q) What is DOM? 


*) DOM stands for Document Object Model. 
*) It is a programming interface for web documents. 
*) It represents the structure of a document (like an HTML page) as a tree of objects,
*) where each object corresponds to a part of the document, such as an element, attribute, or text content. 
*) The DOM allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a webpage dynamically.
