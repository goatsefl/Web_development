// Ajax is Asynchronous Javascript and XML.
// Making requests or get request without interrupting the flow of the page i.e. reloading the page.

// Every Modern webpage has an AJAJ where J stands for JSON.

// Those infinite scrolls are the wonder of Asynchronous code, and to see the requests we can use chrome developer tools.
// Navigate to network, that will show the network traffic of requests made to the server of the main domain.

// Live search is also a request you're sending it to server to quickly fetch the relevant search result.

// Using an API we can send the relevant data, that is packaged in a JSON file.
// JSON is called JavaScript Object Notation is a file that is used to transfer relevant data that is human and machine-readable.

// We need basic data that is stored in JSON file, how do we access it?
// We use API's (Application User Interface) to communicate to different PC's to send/request data.
// We use WEB API to send/request data from different API providers in internet. These API's use HTTP, different companies like google, reddit and facebook have API's for developer's use case.
// In simple words, it's all data that we need, and API is important to get/provide data.

// These web API's are some URL's that are called the endpoint to send/request data according to the docs.

// openweathermap.org/api is an api providing weather info, if there's a requirement of extensive weather data, then there'll be different prices.
